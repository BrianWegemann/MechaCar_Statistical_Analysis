# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
### The purpose of this project is to help AutosRUs' management identify production issues that are impeding progress through analysis of the production data.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### 1. Based on the data from our analysis, vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values of the dataset. 
### 2. The slop of this model is not zero. This is beacuse the p-Value is 5.35e-11.
### 3. Our model will accurately predict 71.49% of mpg predictions since our r-squared value is .7149. This means that almost 1 third of our mpg predictions will be wrong making this model quite ineffective.

### After running the above analysis, it is clear to us that the current manufacturing data does now meet the design specification of 100 PSI max for each lot, although it does as a whole. The overall variance for all lots is 62.3 PSI which is well under the max of 100 PSI. However, when looking at the lots individually, we can see that lot 3 has a variance of 170, pushing it well past the 100 PSI limit for variance.
